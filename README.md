# SmartDebug: An Interactive Java Debug Assistant

SmartDebug is an interactive Java debug assistant. It utilizes programmers' judgement of program running state by taking in specifications on "Checkpoints", makes it possible that complicated debug tasks are split into small fragment of tasks. It works as an eclipse plug-in.

This is the "defects4J" branch containing code for experiments on defects4J benchmark, including data log and analysis scripts.

The master branch contains two features: "interactive debugging" and "early filtration".
